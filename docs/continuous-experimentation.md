# Continuous Experimentation

### Experiment

Since new features are being tested for the application, the most suitable experiment that can be conducted would be the A/B Testing. A/B testing is when there are two different versions of the application in order to determine which is the best. Usually, a new feature is shown in one version. Based on this, A/B Testing is the most suitable since it allows to determine which feature would be the best [1].
