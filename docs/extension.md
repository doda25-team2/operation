# Extension Proposal

### Current State: 

With the current state of the project it is going well as most steps/features from the previous assignments has been implemented and should be in the excellent category. Although this isn't completed within the deadline weeks.

### Release-Engineering Related Shortcoming:

One of the release-engineering related shortcoming that will be discussed in this extension proposal is the **contribution process** for this project. Although we all contribute perfectly but we do not finish our tasks within the assigned week. The work tends to get completed the following week which is good but then for the next assignment the same issue occurs. The reason why this is considered as a release-enginering shortcoming is due to the following:

- The contribution process slows down integration in which many features/steps have missed deadline increasing the workload.
- This can create merge conflicts which has happened for assignment 2. These merge conflicts can delay further work done by each person which slows work.
- The contribution process can lead to low quality or inconsistent code.
- Sometimes reviewers don't review the PRs open which leads to the problems mentioned above.

### Extension

A proposed extension connected to the shortcoming discussed above is the following:

- Implementation of a CI checkpoint: A mini-deadline can be added every mid week in order to have some work done and it will be automatically checked. 
- Add automation such that it requests reviewers automatically every time a PR is open.

### Drawbacks

The possible drawbacks is that the mid-week deadline can add more pressure to the developers which can already impact the code quality and workload especially with different course deadline coming. Adding automation can increase computation usage.
